# portlint2 TODOLIST

## Probable evolutions
* Make maintainers' email addresses case insensitive

## Possible evolutions
* Checking the existence of domains in maintainer's email addresses
* Checking the depends fields (extract/patch/fetch/build/run):
  * between the Index and the Makefiles
  * against the existence of the dependencies
* Other Makefiles related checks
* Adding an option to notice port maintainers by email (but I don't
  want to harrass them...)

## Unprobable evolutions
* Build dependencies trees
